          "summary": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Cameron Carr scored 26 points and Obi Agbim hit the winning free throw with 1.3 seconds left to give Baylor an 87-86 victory over UCF on Saturday night. UCF used a 17-6 run, capped by Devan Cambridge's two free throws, to knot it 86-all with 25 seconds left. Following timeouts from both sides with 3.2 seconds remaining, Agbim was fouled by Riley Kugel on a 3-point attempt. Agbim missed his first free throw but made the second, and then purposely shot at the front of the rim ",
