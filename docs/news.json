He\u2019s standing in the left corner, and even after he passes the ball and the shooter releases it, he just stays planted there. There is zero attempt to crash the boards for an offensive rebound or even reset his positioning. This 'No Motor' playstyle is exactly what critics point to when discussing his consistency on the court. He\u2019s basically a spectator while the ball is in the air.  &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/Vegasguy3124   [link] &#32; ",

This would be the prime opportunity for Redick to give Thiero some reps and let him develop.
